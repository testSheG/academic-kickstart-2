My name is Nalin Asanka Gamagedara Arachchilage (too long, isn't it?). I currently work as Postdoctoral Research Fellow in Usable Privacy and Security under the supervision of Professor Konstantin Beznosov in the Laboratory of Education and Research in Software Security Engineering (LERSSE) at University of British Columbia, Canada. Before moving to this beautiful Vancouver, I worked as Postdoctoral Researcher in Systems Security Engineering under the supervision of Professor Andrew Martin in the Cyber Security Center, Department of Computer Science at Oxford University.
